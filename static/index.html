						<h1>The Rebel Force</h1>
						<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Ye-ha! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; Red Five standing by. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
						<h2>The Clone Wars</h2>
						<p>As you wish. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I call it luck. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</li>
							<li>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</li>

							<h3>The Force Unleashed</h3>
							<p>I call it luck. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I'm trying not to, kid. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>
							<h4>The Force Unleashed</h4>
							<p>As you wish. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>

						<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Ye-ha! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
